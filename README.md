# Man-Startup

##### User stories
```
Deliverable stuff that the product owner cares about
Example: Add/Edit user,Admin panel

Break down story into smaller stories
User managment -> Add/Edit user
               -> Query users
```

##### Tasks
```
Non-deliverable stuff, or stuff that the product owner doesn't care about
Example: Design GUI,Implement the user list..
```

##### Sprints
```
Ask
    When does sprint start? (sprint will start 10.10.2019)
    How long will spirnt last? (sprint will last until 15.10.2019)
    What is it to be achieved during sprint? 
                    (during this spring we will implement user managment and admin panel)
    What is definition of DONE?
                    (Story named Query users form is very differend from story named Operations manual, 
                     so for each story write down what means it is DONE)


Sprint backlog format
suggested -> Use wall-based task board

```

##### Defining time and place for daily scrum
```
Let the team decide. If unsure, experiment.
Most teams prefer mornings though.

Disadvantage of afternoon scrums: When you come to work in the
morning, you have to try to remember what you told people yesterday
about what you will be doing today.

Disadvantage of morning scrums: When you come to work in the
morning, you have to try to remember what you did yesterday so that
you can report this.
```

##### Arrange of tech room
```
-> SEAT THE TEAM TOGETHER
    together means:
    - Audiability: Anybody in the team can talk to anybody else without shouting
    - Visibility: Everybody in the team can see everybody else
    - Isolation: Get away from everybody else(so you can stand up and have discussion whenever you want)
-> have big board for backlog
-> project owner the closer the better
```
